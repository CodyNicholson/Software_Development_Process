# Test Data Selection

How can we select a set of meaningful inputs in my domain, and of course corresponding outputs?

These must be inputs that we can run through the software to tell if it behaves correctly in all cases

Test Data Selection is all about picking the inputs that will prove with the most certainty that your software is working

We do this by partitioning our inputs into groups and identifying boundary and edge cases
