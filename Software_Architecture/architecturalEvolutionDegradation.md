# Architectural Evolution Drift Erosion

## Architectural Evolution

When a system evolves, ideally its prescriptive architecture should be modified first

Change the blueprint before you change the system!

In practice, this is often skipped because of short deadlines, lack of documentation, or sloppiness but it should be done

***

## Architectural Degradation

There are two important concepts that have to do with the way a software system evolves, Drift and Erosion

-

### Architectural drift

Introduction of architectural design decisions orthogonal to a system's prescriptive architecture

This happens when you add new things to the system without proper planning, causing the system to become awkward and impractical

-

### Architectural erosion:

Introduction of architectural design decisions that violate a system's prescriptive architecture

We are introducing decisions that don't comply with the prescriptive architecture

The result is architecture of poor quality
