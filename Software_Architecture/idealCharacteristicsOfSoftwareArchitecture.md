# Ideal Characteristics Of Software Architecture

Ideally, software architecture should be **Scalable, have high Cohesion, and have as little Coupling as possible**

***

**Scalability** is the softwares ability to handle the growth of the software

We should develop Scalable software architectures because is very important for our software to have the ability to grow

***

Cohesion is a measure of how strongly related are the elements of a module

We should have **High Cohesion** because we want to develop modules whose elements cooperate to provide a specific piece of functionality rather than modules consisting of elements that provide different unrelated functionality

***

Coupling is a measure of how strongly related are different modules are in our system

**Low Couping** is ideal because it indicates that our different modules in the system are independent from one another

Each module provides a specific piece of functionality and can provide it without relying on other modules
