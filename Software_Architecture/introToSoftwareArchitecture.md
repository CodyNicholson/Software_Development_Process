# Intro To Software Architecture

#### A General Definition of Software Architecture:

A set of principal design decisions about the system

'Principal' just means a degree of importance that grants a design decision architectural status

-

When building a system we make tons of design decisions, most of which do not impact the architecture of the system

For example, deciding whether to use a for loop or a while loop does not affect the system architecture

However, if you believe that something is an important design decision, that becomes a architecture decision

-

The software architecture is the blueprint for the system that encompasses structure, behavior, interactions, and the non-functional properties of the system

A software architecture is not defined all at one time, but iteratively over time

At any point in time there is a Software Architecture but it will change

Design decisions are made, unmade, and changed over a system's lifetime

***

### Two formal definitions for Software Architecture:

1 - Perry and Wolf Definition

Software Architecture can be defined as Elements, Form, and Rationale

Elements are the WHAT of the system which includes processes, data, and connectors that compose a Software Architecture

Form is the HOW of the system which includes the set of properties and relationships among these elements

Rationale is the WHY of the system which includes the justification for the elements and their relationships

-

2 - Shaw and Garland

Software Architecture is the level of design that involves:

a. Description of elements from which systems are built

b. Interactions among those elements

c. Patterns that guide their composition

d. Constraints on these patterns
