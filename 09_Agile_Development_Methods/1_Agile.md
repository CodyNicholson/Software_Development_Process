# Agile Software Development

By investing in planning correctly and creating models, we save time and money in the long run

There is value in waiting because we don't want to redo things, we want to get it right the first time

Agile aims at a flat cost, meaning that even though we will delay the project with our planning we will not increase the cost

### Agile principles:

Focus on the code rather than design - to avoid unnecessary changes

Value people over process - reward people

Iterative approach - create quickly, evolve quickly based on feedback

Customer involvement - Source of the most important feedback

Expectation that requirements will change - Cannot count on specs to be static

Simplicity - simple design, simple code, but not inadequate
