# Scrum

Scrum is another Agile Dev process similar to XP

-

#### There are 3 main people involved in Scrum

Product Owner (Customer) - Responsible for product back log, the list of things that have to be done for the project

Development Team - A team consisting of 4-9 people responsible for delivering shippable increments and to estimate the back log items

Scrum Master - The person who is responsible for the overall scrum process -- they remove obstacles, facilitate events, and help communication -- the manager of the scrum process

### The Scrum Process

#### Product Backlog

The single source of requirements for the process the product owner defines a list of tasks to be completed by the dev team

Items can be added to this list or removed at any time by the customer

-

#### Sprint Planning

The next sprint or increment is defined, the next backlog items of interest are selected based on priority

The items are converted into tasks that result in the Sprint Backlog

-

#### Sprint Backlog

The set of backlog items that will be completed during the next sprint

The sprint is an iteration of the scrum process

The main part of a sprint lasts 2-4 weeks

Within the main part of the sprint there are many daily scrums that last 24 hours

-

#### Daily Scrum

Usually starts with a 50min meeting at the beginning of the day for the team to sync

At the meeting they discuss the accomplishments since the last meeting, a to-do list for the next meeting is produced, there is an obstacle analysis with possible solutions proposed


#### Sprint Review and Retrospective

At the end of a 2-4 week cycle there is a sprint review and retrospective that consists of a 4hr meeting

The product owner assesses the accomplishments from the previous sprints

The dev team discusses issues that were encountered and solved

There is typically a demo of the deliverable for that sprint

The product owner will discuss the backlog to decide what to do next

In the retrospective they discuss possible process improvements, and to plan how to implement them and use them in the next iteration

-

#### Potentially Shippable Producer Increment

If the product increment is good enough where it reaches the state in which it can be shipped, that could result in a production release
