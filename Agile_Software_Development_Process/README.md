# Agile Software Development
The Agile Software Development Process makes developing software an iterative process that focuses on the quality of the code rather than the design

It makes sure customer feedback play an important role in the development and refinement of the system and values the people over the process

Agile's iterative approach and simple design makes the project easy and inexpensive to modify if the spec changes

This process is ideal for a smaller software projects that expect to change often
