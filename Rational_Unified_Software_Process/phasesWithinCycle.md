# Phases within a Cycle

The four phases within a software cycle -- Inception, Elaboration, Construction, Transition -- are very similar to the phases of software development: Requirements Engineering, Design, Implementation, Verification and Validation, and Maintenance

***

Requirements Engineering starts in the Inception phase but is mostly done in the Elaboration phase and then continues to a lesser extent in the construction phase until it ends in the Transition phase

-

Analysis/Design also starts in the inception phase and is mostly done in the Elaboration phase but is also worked on an equal amount in the Construction phase before tapering off and finishing early in the Transition phase

-

Implementation starts in the Elaboration phase but happens mostly in the Construction Phase before tapering off in the Transition phase

-

Testing happens a lot in every phase besides the Inception phase, and tends to happen a lot more at the end of cycles

-

Deployment starts at the end of the Inception phase and steadily increases throughout the rest of the phases, happening the most in the Transition phase

-

Business Modeling happens mostly in the Inception and Elaboration phase before tapering off during the rest of the phases in the cycle
