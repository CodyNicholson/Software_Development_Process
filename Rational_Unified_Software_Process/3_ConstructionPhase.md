# Construction Phase

If the Elaboration phase is successful we move to the Construction phase

***

This is the phase where most of the actual development occurs

All the features are considered are developed and also thoroughly tested

The Construction phase is where there is a shift from intellectual property development to property development, ideas to product

***

The outcome of the construction phase is a product that is ready to be deployed to the users

#### Specifically, this phase develops the following outcomes:

```
1. All the use-cases have been realized with traceability information

  This means not only that all the functionality expressed by the use cases
  have been implemented but also that we have traceability information from
  the use cases to the different artifacts

  For example, we know which part of the design realizes which use-cases,
  we know which part of the implementation is related to a given use-case,
  we know which use-cases were derived from a use-case model and so on

  In this way we can trace our requirements throughout the system,
  throughout the different artifacts that were developed during the
  software process

-

2. We also have the complete software product which is integrated on
   all the needed platforms

-

3. Since the system has to be thoroughly tested we will also have a
   complete set of results for our system test

-

4. We will finalize the User Manual to be release ready

-

5. We will have a complete set of artifacts
   -- design, code, test cases -- that have been produced
   during the development process
```

***

At the end of this phase we should have a typical beta release copy ready to go

***

#### To evaluate the Construction phase we ask:

1. Is the product stable/mature enough to be deployed to users?

2. Are the stakeholders ready for the transition into the user community? Are we ready to go from development into production?

3. Are the actual resource expenditures versus planned expenditures still acceptable? We our estimates accurate enough with respect to what we spent up until this point?

***

Unless we can answer in a positive way to all of these questions the transition might be postponed by one release because we are still not ready to go to the market, we cannot deploy the product
