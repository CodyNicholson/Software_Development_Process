# Elaboration Phase

#### There are four main goals for the Elaboration phase:

### 1. Analyze the problem domain

### 2. Establish architectural foundation

### 3. Eliminate highest risk elements (address most in critical use-cases)

### 4. Refine the plan of activities and estimates of resources to complete the project

***

The outcome of the Elaboration phase reflects these activities and also in this case produces several artifacts:

1. Almost complete use-case model with all use-cases and actors identified and most use-case descriptions developed

2. Identify a set of supplementary requirements (All the requirements that are not associated with with a use-case) including non-functional requirements (Security, reliability, maintainability)

3. Software Architecture - We take the initial architecture defined in the Inception phase and we refine it until we get to a software architecture that is complete and part of the deliverables for this phase

4. Design model, test cases, executable prototype

5. Revised project plan and risk assessment

6. Preliminary user manual that describes to the user how the system can and should be used

***

### Evaluating the Elaboration phase

Are the vision and architecture stable? Do we have a complete vision for the system?

Does the prototype show that the major risks have been addressed/resolved?

Is the plan sufficiently detailed and accurate?

Do all stakeholders agree that the vision can be achieved with the current plan?

Is the actual resource expenditure versus planned expenditure acceptable? Are our estimates correct?

If the Elaboration phase is not passed the project might be canceled or considerably rethought
