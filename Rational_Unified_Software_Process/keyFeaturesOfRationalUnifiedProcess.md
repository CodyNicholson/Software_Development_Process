# Key Features of Rational Unified Project

The Rational Unified Process (RUP) is a Software Process Model

This means that RUP defines an order of phases that has to be followed, and it prescribes transition criteria so it knows when to go from one phase to another

It also means that RUP is component based, meaning two things:

-

1. That the software system is defined and built as a set of software components (Software components are the building blocks of the system)

2. There must be well-defined interfaces between these components, interfaces through which these components communicate

-

The RUP is tightly related to Unified Modeling Language (UML), in particular, it relies extensively on UML for its notation, and with respect to its basic principles

Finally, the three main distinguishing aspects of RUP are that it is Use-Case Driven, Architecture-centric, and Iterative and Incremental
