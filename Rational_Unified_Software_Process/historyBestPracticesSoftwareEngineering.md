# History of Best Practices of Software Engineering

In 1997, Rational Unified Process defined six best practices for modern software engineering

1. Develop iteratively, focusing on risk
2. Manage requirements, including updating them and keeping traceability information between requirements and other software artifacts
3. Employ a component-based architecture, have a high level design that focuses on cooperating components that are nevertheless very cohesive and highly decoupled
4. Model software visually, use visual diagrams, in particular UML diagrams, in a very extensive way so as to make artifacts easier to understand and agree upon among stakeholders
5. Continuously verify quality, since the process is defined in an iterative way, it allows for performing quality assurance activities in a continuous way throughout development
6. Control changes, change management and control were also at the center of the rational approach
