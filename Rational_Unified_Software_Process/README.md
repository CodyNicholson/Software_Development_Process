# Rational Unified Software Process
The Rational Unified Software Process (RUP) is a Use-Case Driven, Architecture-centric, Iterative and Incremental software process that is similar to Unified Modeling Language. By prioritizing and implementing the highest risk functionality in each cycle this process is a flexible, safe, and effective way to develop software systems. RUP uses all of the software engineering principles -- Requirements Engineering, Design, Implementation, Validation and Verification, Maintenance -- concurrently throughout its four phases phases -- Inception, Elaboration, Construction, Transition -- to solve problems that it could not solve in previous iterations.
