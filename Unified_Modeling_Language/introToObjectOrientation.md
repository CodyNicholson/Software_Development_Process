# What is Object Orientation?

### Data Over Function:

To think in terms of objects you have to give precedence to data over functionality

### Information Hiding and Encapsulation:

Information hiding is the principle of encapsulation and the segregation of data behind well defined and stable interfaces in order to hide the design and implementation decisions

Encapsulation is the technique of information hiding

The key concept of information hiding and encapsulation is to gather and seclude data behind a wall, and to give access to the data only through interfaces that the developer define

Information hiding makes code more maintainable because the rest of the system doesn't have to be concerned with how the implementation details or the design are defined

Any change that happens behind the wall created by information hiding does not concern or affect the rest of the system as long as you keep your interfaces consistent

-

### Inheritance:

Another advantage of focusing on objects and encapsulating information into cohesive entities is that it allows the reuse of object definitions and incremental refinement, otherwise known as inheritance
