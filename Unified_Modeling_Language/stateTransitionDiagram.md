# State Transition Diagram

A State Transition Diagram is defined for each relevant class in the system and shows the life history of a given class of object

This means that it describes the possible states of the class as defined by the values of the class attributes

Also describes the events that cause a transition from one state to another

Lastly, it describes the actions that result from a state change

***

### State Transition Diagram Notation:

States are represented by ovals with a name

Then we have transitions which are arrows pointing from one state to another which are labeled after the events and/or actions that caused them with the attributes and boolean conditions required included

States should also have their entry action, their activities, and their exit action labeled under their names in the oval
