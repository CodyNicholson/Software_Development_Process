# Deployment Diagram

The deployment diagram provides a static deployment view of a system

Physical allocation of components to computational units, for example, in a client server system

***

Node = computational unit, for example, a specific device

You can also see which components are deployed on which nodes because the components will be contained in the node

***

Edge = communication between nodes labeled with the method by which they communicate
