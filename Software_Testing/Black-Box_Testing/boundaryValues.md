# Boundary Values

Errors tend to occur at the boundary of a domain/subdomain because these are the cases that are less understood by developers

If this is true we want to select inputs at these boundaries

This is helpful in Partition Testing because Partition Testing will identify the partitions we want to select inputs, so the selection of boundary values will help
