# Random Testing

In Random Testing we pick the inputs to test randomly

***

#### Advantages:

Picks inputs uniformly

All inputs are considered equal

No designer bias, which is the problem of a developer assuming a given behavior of the user

-

#### Disadvantage:

We are looking for a needle in a haystack, we might be looking for the failures in all the wrong places
