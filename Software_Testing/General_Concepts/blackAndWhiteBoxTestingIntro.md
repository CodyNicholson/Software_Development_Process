# Black and White Box Testing Intro

### Black-Box Testing

Black box testing is the kind of testing in which we consider the software as a closed box, we never look at the code inside the software, we are only going to look at the description of the software

This Testing is all based on the description of the software (specification)

Black box testing tries to cover as much specified behavior as possible

It cannot reveal errors do to implementation details

***

### White-Box Testing

White box testing looks into the software code to find errors in the implementation and uses this information to preform the testing

Based on the code

Goal is to cover as much code behavior as possible

Cannot reveal errors due to missing paths, where missing paths are a part of a software specification that are not implemented because it is focused on the code not on the specification
