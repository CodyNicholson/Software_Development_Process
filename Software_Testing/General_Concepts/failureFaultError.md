# Failure, Fault, Error

The terms Failure, Fault, and Error are often used interchangeably when they each actually have their own unique definition that is important to know in Software Testing

-

## As Defined by the IEEE:

### Failure

An observable incorrect behavior of the software

It is conceptually related to the behavior of the program rather than its code

-

### Fault

Also called 'bug'

An incorrect piece of code, in other words, a fault is related to the code and is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the occurrence of a failure

-

### Error

An error is the cause of a fault

It is usually a human error, which can be conceptual, a typo, or something along those lines
