# Alpha Vs Beta Testing

Unit, Integration, System, Acceptance, and Regression Testing are all performed within the testing organization or by third party testers

***

### There are two other types of testing that are also worth mentioning:

**Alpha Testing** is the next step after the Developer's testing and is testing performed by distributing a software system ready to be released to a set of users that are internal to the organization that developed the software

-

These alpha testers will likely discover errors that escaped the testing and will have made it to the field not caught

**Beta testing** is the next step after Alpha testing in which the software is released to a selected subset of users outside the organization who are also likely to discover latent errors in the code before it is officially released to the public

***

We preform both Alpha and Beta testing is because Alpha testing will allow us to iron out the very obvious issues that escaped testing before the software reaches people outside the organization

Beta testing will will have a higher tolerance for issues than Alpha testers causing them catch more specific issues
