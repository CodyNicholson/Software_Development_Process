# Testing Intro

Testing is the act of executing a program on a tiny sample of the input domain

Testing is a dynamic technique meaning that the program must be executed in order to perform testing

Testing is optimistic approximation because the program at test is exercised with a very small subset of all the possible inputs

This is done under the assumption that the behavior with any other input is consistent with the behavior shown for the selected subset of input data, which is why it is an optimistic approach

What makes a Successful Test?

A test is successful if it fails!

If tests never fail then there must be something wrong and you must have devised a bad set of tests that are not able to reveal failures of the program

A test is successful if you can show that there are problems in the program
