# White-Box Testing
White-Box Testing, also called Functional Testing, is a type of testing that focuses on finding the problems with the code inside the software system, unlike Black-Box Testing that does not focus on the code and is more concerned with the behavior of the system

This type of testing works on a formal model, like a Control Flow Diagram, so we can obtain objective results from this type of testing

White-Box Testing also allows us to compare different test suites against each other because we can measure the coverage achieved by every individual test suite

One of the best features of White-Box Testing and coverage criteria is that they is fully automate-able
