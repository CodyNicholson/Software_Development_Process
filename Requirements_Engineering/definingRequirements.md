# Defining Requirements

What are the requirements?

***

## There are three domains:

### The domain of the machine

Hardware, operating system, libraries in which the software will run

Characterized by computers and programs

For example, an algorithm to sort the application data in the background

-

### The domain of the application

The world in which the software will operate

Characterized by the domain properties and the requirements

Domain properties represent the assumptions we make on the domain

For example, an employee wanting to organize a meeting

***

## The overlap between the two domains called specifications

A formal description of what the machine should do to meet the requirements

A bridge between the two domains

For example, if you press a button in the application the machine can detect and react to it
