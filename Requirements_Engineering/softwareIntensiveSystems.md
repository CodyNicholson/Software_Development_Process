# Software Intensive Systems

Software is an abstract description of a set of computations that becomes concrete when we run the software on some hardware, and in the context of some human activity that it can support

***

#### What we mean when we say "the system" -- like in System Testing:

Software Intensive System which is the software, the system on which it runs, and the context in which the software is used

-

In Requirements Engineering we need to pay extra close attention to the hardware and the context that our software will run in to make certain that we build the customer exactly what they want
