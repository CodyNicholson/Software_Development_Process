# The Requirements Engineering Process has four steps

## Elicitation

Where we extract requirements from different sources

***

## Negotiation

Happens between stakeholders and developers

Requirements are discussed and modified until an agreement is met

***

## Modeling

Where we represent the requirements using one or more notations or formal reasons

***

## Analysis

Identify possible issues with our requirements

***

#### Repeat the process from the start until system is complete
