# Identifying Purpose

Identifying the purpose of a software system is the same as defining its requirements

***

### Defining these requirements is difficult because of:

The sheer complexity of the purpose/requirements

Often the people don't know what they want until you show them

Changing requirements

Multiple stakeholders with conflicting requirements

***

## Two things to consider when planning to develop software:

#### Completeness:

Often functionality is added to a software project after it is released because the software is incomplete

Considering all uses for the software based on its purpose will make the project go smoothly

-

#### Pertinence:

Pertinence has to do with the relevance of the requirements

Try not to add features that are not necessary because you will over-complicate the software
