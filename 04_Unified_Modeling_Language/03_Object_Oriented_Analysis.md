# Object Oriented Analysis

A requirements analysis technique that concentrates on modeling real-world objects

The Object Modeling Technique consists of Data, Functions, and Control and evolved into the Unified Modeling Language

UML extends OMT by providing more diagrams and a broader system from multiple perspectives

***

The basic idea is to focus on the real world objects so you can make requirements accordingly

#### There are four steps in this process:

1. Obtain/prepare textual description of problem so we know what system to build

2. Underline nouns in the description to make classes

3. Underline adjectives in the description because they will become attributes in the system

4. Underline active verbs in the description because they will become operations in the system
