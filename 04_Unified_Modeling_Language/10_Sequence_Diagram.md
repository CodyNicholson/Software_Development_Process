# Sequence Diagram

A Sequence Diagram is an interaction diagram that emphasizes the time ordering of messages

To create a sequence diagram you start by placing all of the participating intractable objects in sequential order on the x-axis at the top of your diagram, the first object should be able to initialize the others

Next, draw the Object Lifeline by placing dashed vertical lines starting from each object pointing directly down the rest of the graph, for the first object make it a solid line

For the first object draw numbered arrows pointing to the next object's lifeline for each interaction that effects the next object, place a short message above the arrow line that describes the interaction
