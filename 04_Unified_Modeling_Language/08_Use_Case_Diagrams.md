# Use Case Diagrams

### Use Cases:

Describes the outside view of the system

The Use Case represents the sequence of interactions of outside entities (actors) with the system and the system actions that yields an observable result of value to the actors

Use Cases are also called scenarios, scripts, or user stories

***

### Actors of Use Cases:

Use cases all have an actor which is a human or a device that plays a role within the system

An entity can play more than one role in the system

More than one entity can play the same role

Actors may appear in more than one use case

***

### Format of Use Cases:

The behavior of a use case can be specified by describing its flow of events like how the use case starts and ends, normal flow of time, alternative flow of events, and exceptional flow of events

***

### Documenting Use Cases:

Documenting use cases can happen in a formal way with pre and post conditions and pseudo code to describe the steps or an informal way which is a textual description

***

### Role of Use Cases:

User cases are good for requirements elicitation, that is, it is easier to describe what the system should do if we think of think of the system in terms of what the user will do

Use Cases can also be used for Architectural Analysis because they can help define the main blocks of the system, and can there for define the initial architecture of the system

They can be used for User Prioritization because when you think about the system in terms of the user then you prioritize the parts of the project that the user absolutely needs

Use Cases are useful for planning

Use Cases are very important for testing because you need to anticipate all of the problems/bugs the user will have with the system

***

### Use Cases Creation Tips:

Use names that communicates purpose

Define one atomic behavior per use case

Define flow of events clearly

Provide only essential details

Factor common behaviors and variants
