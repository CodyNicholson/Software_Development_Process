# Phase and Iterations

What is the difference between the Rational Unified Process (RUP) and the tradition software engineering phases and activities?

The answer is that all of the software engineering principles are used in RUP but RUP uses these principles together throughout all of its four phases concurrently because that allows RUP in subsequent iterations to address problems that came up in previous iterations
