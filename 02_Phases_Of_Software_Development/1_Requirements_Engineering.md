# Requirements Engineering

Requirements Engineering is the process of establishing the needs of stakeholders that are to be solved by software

The Cost of Late Correction goes up and up as the software process continues

For example, fixing a problem in the Requirements Engineering phase might only cost 1, but fixing it in the Design phase it will cost 5, in implementation 10, in Testing 50, and in maintenance it will cost around 100 -- which is 100 times more expensive than fixing the same issue in the Requirements Engineering phase

##### Finding problems early is the name of the game

***

#### The first step to defining the requirements is Elicitation

Elicitation is the collection of requirements from stakeholders and customers

-

#### The second is Analysis:

Analysis is the study of the deeper understanding of the requirement

-

#### The third step is Specification:

This is where the collective requirements are suitably recognized and saved so that they can be shared

-

#### The fourth step is Validation:

After the requirements can be shared, they can be validated to make sure that they are complete, consistent, non-redundant so that they satisfy a set of known properties for requirements

-

#### The fifth step is Management:

Accounts for changes in requirements during the lifetime of the project
