# Implementation

After we Design our system we can begin to Implement it

***

## There are four foundational principles that can affect Software Implementation


### 1. Reduction of Complexity

This aims to build software that is easier to understand and use

-

### 2. Anticipation of Diversity

Takes into account that software construction might change in various ways over time

Software evolves, sometimes in unexpected ways and we must be able to anticipate and adapt to these changes

-

### 3. Structuring for Validation/Design for Testability

We want to build software that is easily testable during the Validation and Verification steps of the Software Dev Process

-

### 4. Use of Internal and External Standards

Like the Internal Standard by which we name variables when we code

If the software is built for a specific field, like medical for example, you should make it so that it follows their External Standards for usability
