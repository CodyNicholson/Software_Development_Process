# Verification and Validation

The Verification and Validation Phase aims to make sure that the Software meets is specification and meets its intended purpose

***

### Validation

Did we build the system that the customer wants and will make them happy?

-

### Verification

Did we build the system right?

Given the description of the system from the customer, did we build the system according to the specification that we defined?

-

The Verification Step can be preformed at the Unit level in which we test that the individual units work as expected

Verification is then performed at the the Integration level, where the individual unit/modules are tested to work together

-

Lastly, we verify that the system as a whole is fully functional and works together as one big unit in System/Acceptance Testing

This is also the step where we apply other testing techniques like Validation, Stress Testing, and Robustness Testing
