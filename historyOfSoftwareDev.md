# NATO Software Engineering Conference of 1969:

This was a meeting held to address the issue of over complex software development

Back then software was developing faster than the developers could learn how to use it,

The demand for software development was also very high

-

At the conference they defined the best practices for developing software

This lead to the birth of Software Engineering

-

It was meetings like this one that changeed Development, Language, and Debugging to make creating software much more effiecent

In Development we went from punch cards to IDEs (Integrated Development Environment)

In Language we went from Machine Code to High-Level Languages

In Debugging we went from Print Lines to Symbolic Debuggers (git, Coverage & Verification Tools)
