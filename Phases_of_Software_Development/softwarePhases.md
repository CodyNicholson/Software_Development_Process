# The Software Phases in order

## Requirements Engineering:

We talk to the customer and the stakeholders and try to decide what kind of system to build

-

## Design:

We use the details provided by the customer/stakeholders to create a design for our software system

-

## Implementation:

We start to write the code and build the software system

-

## Verification and Validation:

We need to test our code to verify that if behaves like intended

-

## Maintenance:

To maintain that code we might need to add new functionality, eliminate bugs from the code, or respond to feedback from the systems users
