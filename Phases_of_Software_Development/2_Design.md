# Design

In the Design phase software requirements are analyzed in order to produce a description of the internal structure and organizational distinction

***

### The design phase consists of Design Activities

Design activities could consist of Architectural Design, Abstract Specification, Interface Design, Component Design, Data Structure, and Algorithm Design

We will usually go from a high level Architectural Design to a low level Algorithm Design

-

These activities result in a set of Design Products which describe various characteristics of the system

Design Products are: System Structure, Software Specification, Interface Specification, Component Specification, Data Structure Specification, and Algorithm Specification

These products describe how the  system is decomposed and organized into components, the interfaces between these components, they also describe these components into a level of details that are suitable for allowing their construction
