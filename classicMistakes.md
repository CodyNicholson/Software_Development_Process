# Classic mistakes made in the Software Development Process

### Heroics

This is the person who thinks they can do everything on their own

The problem is that it discourages cooperation and encourages extreme risk taking

Forces someone to take on lots of responsibility

Ends in failure

#### What you want instead

Apply software engineering principles

Have collaboration without too much weight on individuals

***

### Work Environment
-

There is evidence that the work environment has an effect on overall productivity of the workers

***

### People Management

Poor leadership leads to poor productivity

Adding people to a project that is behind schedule always ends in failure because they need to get past the learning curve

***

### Scheduling Issues:

Give yourself more time than you think you need to be safe

Don't overestimate the abilities of people involved

***

### Planning Issues:

If you don't plan correctly, you are planning to fail

***

### Failures:

Failure can occur if the quality of the product is low, or not tested well enough

***

### Product Mistakes:

Gold Plating of Requirements

It is very common for products to have more requirements then they need

Lengthens the project development unnecessarily

***

### Feature Creep:


Adding more and more features then were initially planned that are not needed

***

### Research != Development:

If you need to use new techniques or learn new knowledge to create the project, you will be doing more research then development

***

## Technology Mistakes:

### Silver Bullet Syndrome:

Too much reliance on the advertisement benefits on previously unused technology

We cannot expect technology alone to solve our software development problems

-

### Switching or Adding Tools:

Adds a steep learning curve to the devs that can pull the project backwards


### No Version Control:

Version control is far too beneficial to ignore in the software dev process

Without version control the project can get out of hand and no one will remember what code does what
