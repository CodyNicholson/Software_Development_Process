# Why do we Refactor?

Requirements change, and when they do we often need to change our design accordingly

Once our design model works, we might need to improve it and optimize it

We might want to make our code more maintainable, we might want to add a new feature, or maybe we just wrote sloppy code the first time and want to make it nicer
