# Components, Connectors, Configurations

A **Software Component** is an architectural entity that encapsulates a subset of the system's functionality and/or data

Components typically provide application specific services

Software components also restrict access to that subset via an explicitly defined interface

Components can also have their own specifically defined dependencies on its required execution environment

***

A **Software Connector** is an architectural entity effecting and regulating interaction among components

Connectors typically provide application independent interaction facilities

In application, connectors might simply be procedure calls or shared data accesses but they could also be very complex

***

A **Software Architecture Configuration** is the place where Components and Connectors are all composed in a specific way in a system architecture to accomplish a systems objective

More specifically, Architectural Configuration is an association between components and connectors of a software architecture
