# Software Process

The Software Process exists to solve the otherwise unmanageable task of taking an idea from a customer and turning it into a software system

This process consists of breaking the task down into formal steps

***

### The Software Development Process consists of four main processes:

#### 1 - Waterfall

We go from one phase to the other like a waterfall

-

#### 2 - Evolutionary Prototyping

Instead of following the waterfall, now we start with a prototype and evolve it incrementally

-

#### 3 - Rational Unified Process/Unified Software Process

UML

-

#### 4 - Agile

Lastly, we sacrifice the discipline a bit so that we can be more flexible and ready for changes
