# The Spiral Process

The Spiral Model is an incremental risk-oriented lifecycle model that has four main phases:

### 1 - Determine Objectives

Define requirements

-

### 2 - Identify and Resolve Risks

Identify risks and create prototype

-

### 3 - Development and Tests

Develop the code  and create tests based on the prototype and the risks defined in the last step

-

### 4 - Plan the next Iteration

Evaluate the output of the current iteration and plan the next iteration

***

#### Advantages:

Reduced risk since the process is so iterative

Functionality can be added easily

Software produced early and then constantly improved with early customer feedback

-

#### Disadvantages:

The risk analysis requires a highly specific expertise

The whole process is dependent on risk analysis

More complex than other models, like the waterfall modal
