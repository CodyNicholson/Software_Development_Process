# The Waterfall Process

The Waterfall process is named this because you cannot start one step until you finish another, and thus you 'Waterfall' from each step to the next step

At the end of each step, a meeting will be heald to determine whether the project is ready to 'Waterfall' to the next phase

This modal works well when you have a stable project definition, the domain is well known, and the technologies involved are well understood

***

#### Advantage:

By using the Waterfall Process we can catch errors early since we will not work on the next step until the current step is working correctly

-

#### Disadvantage:

Not flexible, if requirements change or errors occur it is expensive to fix in this model
