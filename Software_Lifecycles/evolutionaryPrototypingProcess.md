# The Evolutionary Prototyping Process works in four main phases


1 - Initial Concept

The customer and devs work together to define the requirements

-

2 - Design and Implement Initial Prototype

Instead of worrying about developing a whole system developers can focus on developing the parts that they understand

-

3 - Refine Prototype Until Acceptable

Developers continue working on the system until it is good enough for the customer to be happy

-

4 - Complete and Release Prototype

Release the finished prototype
