# Extract Method

We start with a cohesive code fragment in a large method

We then create a method using that code fragment and then replace the code fragment with a call to that method

This is just like extracting a class, but with methods

#### Example:

````java
void printTotalAndDetails(int x, int y, int z)
{
    int total = x + y + z;
    System.out.println("The total is: " + total);
    System.out.println("x represents: " + x);
    System.out.println("y represents: " + y);
    System.out.println("z represents: " + z);
}
```

####This could be changed to:

```java
void printTotalAndDetails(int x, int y, int z)
{
    int total = x + y + z;
    printDetails(x, y, z);
}

void printDetails(int x, int y, int z)
{
    System.out.println("x represents: " + x);
    System.out.println("y represents: " + y);
    System.out.println("z represents: " + z);
}
```
