# Refactoring History

Refactoring is something programmers have always done

It is especially important for object-oriented languages

Opdyke's PhD Thesis (1990) discusses refactoring for SMALLTALK

Increasingly popular due to agile development since environments change more quickly

"Improving the Design of Existing Code" is a book by Martin Fowler that contains a catalog of refactoring, a list of bad smells, guidelines on when and how to apply refactoring, and examples of code before and after refactoring
