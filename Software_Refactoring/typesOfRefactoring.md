Add parameter, change association, reference to value, value to reference, collapse hierarchy, consolidate conditionals, procedures to objects, decompose conditionals, encapsulate collection, encapsulate downcast, encapsulate field, extract method, extract class, inline class, form template method, hide delegate, hide method, inline temp, etc
