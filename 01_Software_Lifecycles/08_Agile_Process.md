# Agile is a type of Test Driven Development (TDD)

### 1 - Write a test that fails

  Create a test case that would pass if the software was complete, but it isn't complete yet so it will fail

### 2 - Make only enough to pass the tests

  Make all of those test cases pass by developing the software only enough to pass the test cases

### 3 - Refactor

  Modify the code to make it more readable and maintainable, then restart this process from step one
