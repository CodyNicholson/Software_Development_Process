# Choosing a Design Pattern

To choose a design pattern you must first make sure that you:

1. Understand your design context.What are you designing, and what are the issues involved with this design?What are the problems you need to solve?

2. Examine the patterns catalog

3. Identify and study related patterns

4. Apply a suitable pattern and be mindful that there are pitfalls in the use of patterns. Choosing the wrong pattern can make your design worse. You could also use too many patterns and design your system to be more complex then it needs to be.
